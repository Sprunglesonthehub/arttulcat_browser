## Introduction

Tired of browsers that track your every move, push unwanted features, and feel heavy? **ArttulCat** is here to change that.

Born from the robust and open-source foundation of Mozilla Firefox, ArttulCat is a meticulously crafted browser fork dedicated to empowering you. We believe that your online experience should be private, secure, and entirely within your control. We've fine-tuned Firefox to shed unnecessary baggage, enhance privacy protections by default, and deliver a truly liberating browsing experience.

## Why Choose ArttulCat?

More than just a browser, ArttulCat is a statement. It's a commitment to a web that respects its users. Here's what makes ArttulCat stand out:

### Privacy Prowess
We put your privacy first. ArttulCat is engineered from the ground up to minimize data collection and resist tracking.
*   **Zero Telemetry & Data Collection:** Your browsing habits are yours alone. We've disabled all default telemetry and data collection that sends information back to Mozilla or anyone else.
*   **Enhanced Privacy Defaults:** Stricter referrer policies, improved first-party isolation, and robust anti-fingerprinting measures are enabled by default, making it harder for sites to track you across the web.
*   **Built-in Ad & Tracker Blocking:** Enjoy a cleaner, faster web. Our integrated blocking capabilities significantly reduce intrusive ads and malicious trackers.
*   **Secure & Private DNS:** Configured for private DNS resolution by default (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS), further protecting your online queries from prying eyes.

### Unleashed Freedom
We champion your control over your browser and your data.
*   **Community-Driven Development:** ArttulCat is developed with transparency and responsiveness to its community. Your feedback matters, guiding our enhancements and features.
*   **No Corporate Agenda:** Free from the pressures of corporate demands, we focus solely on user benefits â€“ performance, privacy, and usability.
*   **User-Centric Configuration:** We provide sensible, privacy-respecting defaults while retaining the vast customizability Firefox is known for, allowing you to tailor your browser exactly to your needs.

### Lean, Mean Browsing Machine
Stripping away unnecessary bloat doesn't just improve privacy; it boosts performance.
*   **Optimized Performance:** By disabling non-essential features and services, ArttulCat runs lighter and faster, offering a smoother and more responsive browsing experience.
*   **Reduced Resource Usage:** Enjoy a browser that's kinder to your system's RAM and CPU, especially beneficial for older hardware or multi-tasking.
